We target specific leagues and teams and Parks and Recs departments, high school athletic associations and Olympic and professional athletes.</p>

                 <p>I’ve found a ton of value in working with Mark’s organization and the contacts he’s connected us with. He answers questions that I don’t even know to ask.  When I started working with him, he spent a lot of time with me, asking me questions. When you’re a startup, time is always of the essence, and I wanted to just get things moving. But he wanted to make sure that what he gave me was exactly what I wanted. So he asked me to be patient and assured me that he would exceed my expectations. Turns out he did a really good job of slowing me down to prevent me from hitting some pitfalls along the way.</p>

                 <p>Mark is very personable and he is an incredible listener. He’s also prompt.
                    He delivers everything he says he will, always on or under budget. He always over-
                    delivers, and as a new business, I can tell you that that is very rarely is the case.”global companies who have been around for 100 years.”</p>
