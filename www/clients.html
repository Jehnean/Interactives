                 <p>“I run an online sports education and consulting website that’s geared towards educating, training and developing players, parents and coaches. We target specific leagues and teams and Parks and Recs departments, high school athletic associations and Olympic and professional athletes.</p>

                 <p>I’ve found a ton of value in working with Mark’s organization and the contacts he’s connected us with. He answers questions that I don’t even know to ask.  When I started working with him, he spent a lot of time with me, asking me questions. When you’re a startup, time is always of the essence, and I wanted to just get things moving. But he wanted to make sure that what he gave me was exactly what I wanted. So he asked me to be patient and assured me that he would exceed my expectations. Turns out he did a really good job of slowing me down to prevent me from hitting some pitfalls along the way.</p>

                 <p>Mark is very personable and he is an incredible listener. He’s also prompt.
                 He delivers everything he says he will, always on or under budget. He always over-delivers, and as a new business, I can tell you that that is very rarely is the case.”</p>

                 <h1>What our customers have to say:</h1>
                 <p>“For the past 17 years, Mark has worked on a number of diverse products for me across two different companies, Cengage Learning and Jones & Bartlett Learning. Mark brings a lot of knowledge to the table: what questions to ask to narrow down the scope of work and get people to focus on the end goals and what will make that end user successful.</p>

                 <p>I approached Mark to come up with a solution for us, which ended up being Studyware, a small homework solution for students. Our goal was to provide a free digital resource that would be useful to students and that would also create a value proposition for instructors and students, and give us an advantage over competitors. We wanted a repeatable design so that other products could offer something similar. Mark developed a very customer-centric design and helped us come up with all our processes. He had a tremendous volume of these, 25 to 45 a year under serious time constraints. Mark always worked very closely with QA; he would come in and work hand in hand with the QA manager, build the test plans, literally be fixing things on the fly.</p>

                 <p>Studyware became the predominant go-to solution for all of our healthcare titles. The platform has been alive for about 15 years – and he was able to build something that was successful, work with our teams, really understand our goals, meet those goals, offer budget flexibility and work under difficult constraints. The longevity of the Studyware product is a testament to Mark’s wherewithal, his creativity, his flexibility as a developer.”</p>

                 <p>“Mark is extremely talented. He has a very deep knowledge base. Because he has done this for so long, he knows all the technological challenges you might face. He is really good at understanding what the issues are, and he doesn’t just give you the solution that works best for him; he lays out your options and tells you the challenges you might face with each one so you can make the right decision for you. It’s a conversation.</p>

                 <p>I trust Mark. He’s very personable and works well with customers. I know he’ll do a good job. I know he’s going to raise red flags when appropriate. And his cost is reasonable. He meets the deadline and he exceeds expectations. He’s my ‘go to’ guy for eLearning. I don’t recommend anyone else.”</p>

                  <p>Working with Mark is a pleasure. He has the gift of ‘tech magic,’ and his deliverables are always, always on time. I never have to beg or plead to get something from him, he always delivers on time. Plus, he’s a great person to work with and he’s very bright. He always figures out workarounds for us that we need. He always tries his best to meet people’s expectations and get things just the way they want. Many times I’m sure he should have gotten paid more because he always went above and beyond for us. I’ve worked with a lot of vendors, and he is by far the best vendor I’ve ever worked with.”</p>

                 <p>“I enjoy working with Mark because he adds a personal touch that we don't get with many vendors these days. He comes into the office to meet with project leads himself, bringing in his developers as needed to talk through complex issues. Mark is very responsive, and good at getting "into the weeds" to understand what the product needs are for the end-user, as well as our needs as a provider of educational solutions. He's great at troubleshooting and brainstorming ways to get to the desired outcome, and he maintains that focus throughout the development process. We jokingly refer to him as an employee, since he's been working with people here for close to 20 years now!”</p>

We consult with him on what technology solutions should be used for various projects. Mark also helped us develop our custom LMS where we stage our clients’ courses, and he helps us host and maintain it, and provides technical support to our users.</p>

                 <p>We also have computer-based simulations and a number of different learning tools that Mark helps us program and update. And because we have a very large library of courses, we have a lot of different clients that use those courses, and Mark helps to support those clients from a technical support point of view. He provides really, professional, very good technical support to help those clients through their technical issues.</p>

                 <p>A big reason to work with Mark is his strong technical ability combined with his excellent communication skills. He is a really strong consultant. He gets it. He figures out the business need quickly and always works with us to come up with a sound recommendation. Mark is a really good contributing member of the team. We view him almost like our technical director. We really enjoy working with Mark and hope to work with him long into the future.”</p>

                 <h1>What our customers have to say:</h1>
                 <p>“We contracted with Mark in 2008 to develop a custom LMS for our company. Because we do sell our proprietary product to clients, we needed an LMS with very specific requirements and couldn’t use an off-the-shelf product. We worked very closely with Mark and his team to develop an LMS to our specs. It’s been phenomenal. Not only is it incredibly easy to use for me as an administrator, it’s easy for user to launch courses, it’s clean and easy to navigate and it’s intuitive. It’s also extremely reliable. Prior to using Mark’s LMS, we did work with an off-the-shelf company and our tech support costs were quite high. We were spending a ton of time and a ton of money on tech support. There were so many issues with the delivery and the reporting. Our tech support costs are almost nothing now. Day-to-day user experience of the LMS is flawless.</p>

                 <p>We recently had to move our LMS to a new service provider, a huge undertaking that probably took 6 months and again, it was seamless because he thinks through all aspects and he’s looking out for all the potential ways to cut costs or optimize the way resources are used. Mark is great at listening to your needs, finding a solution that is the right fit and implementing it.</p>

                 <p>I’ve worked with Mark for close to 20 years, and I consider him a true partner. It’s like we work for the same firm, not like I’m contracting with him to provide a service. He just gets what we do. He participates in our client calls with us and he’s always trying to help us achieve our goals. There are very few people that I work with that are not employees of my firm that I’d allow to talk to a client or email a client and I don’t need to be involved. Mark is one of those people. I absolutely trust him to do the right thing.”</p>

                 <p>“Mark and I have worked together for 16 years. He’s very good at marshaling all the talents needed for a project.  I have access to the subject matter expertise and editorial expertise, and he brings together the programming and the instructional design, and really whatever else I say we’re lacking. Then he manages the schedule and the project. He is very reliable.</p>

                 <p>Mark always understands my expectations, including the unstated ones, and the intended outcomes and implements those in the project plan so I don’t have to attend to every implied detail. With some other vendors, they will only provide the details that are written in an RFP. Then their proposal will not come back as detailed as it needs to be and therefore the product will not come out as I intended it to come out. But Mark always understands my expectations and he gets the big picture.</p>

                 <p>Working with Mark is fabulous. I know I’m going to get what I ask for. He’s also very creative and agile at changing requirements. If I ask for something to be delivered only on a Mac, but the requirement changes and I need it to be delivered on a Mac and a PC and a tablet, I can ask for change order. Then he’ll respond to it quickly and it will work on all platforms and it will be delivered on schedule. He’s very responsive and flexible that way. As far as pricing goes, he is very competitive – and you get what you pay for. He always comes in on budget. There are never any surprises.”</p>

                 <h1>What our customers have to say:</h1>
                 <p>“What I like about working with Mark is he’s incredibly collaborative. He has great resources to draw from, a strong network of people he works with to get things done. Plus he’s up front and honest. He’s proactive. He will alert you to a potential problem ahead of time. I appreciate his willingness to collaborate in a very positive, honest back and forth way. He asks really good questions, he gives you a reality check.</p>

                 <p>He delivers what he says he will. You know you’re going to get what you need and in the schedule that you need it by. He doesn’t over-promise and under-deliver, in fact he under-promises and over-delivers. And his costs are incredibly reasonable.”</p>
