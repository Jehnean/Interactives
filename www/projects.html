                     <h3>Company</h3>
                     <p>Cengage Learning</p>

                     <h3>Challenge</h3>
                     <p>Cengage was in need of a low cost, fast turnaround homework solution that could be included with any number of titles across disciplines.  At the same time, the content of the titles would vary and the product had to adapt.</p>

                     <h3>Solution</h3>
                     <p>We created a modular design where product teams could pull from any of our libraries of functionality based upon the content they had readily available:</p>
                     <ul>
                      <li>Graded quizzes</li>
                      <li>Practice assessments</li>
                      <li>Case studies</li>
                      <li>Vocabulary based games (hangman, flash cards, concentration, spelling bee)</li>
                      <li>Question-based games  (Jeopardy knock off, Tic-tac-toe)</li>
                      <li>Audio dictionary</li>
                      <li>Image labeling exercises</li>
                      <li>Media library</li>
                     </ul>

                     <p>Automated content conversion from the internal formats used by the customer to the final XML format used by the StudyWARE shell.  All content was kept external to the programming to facilitate maintenance and updates.</p>

                     <p>Target turnaround from project kickoff to final delivery was 6 weeks.</p>

                     <p>We delivered a fully brandable shell, so that titles would match look and feel of the associated title.</p>

                     <p>We delivered 25-50 titles per year over 4 major revisions of the shell, on-time and on-budget.</p>

                     <p>Combination of instructional content as well as two ways to practice dealing with life threatening emergencies:</p>

                     <ul>

                     <p>PSI was looking for a long-term partner to guide and assist them in all aspects of integrating eLearning to their existing stand up training and consulting practice.</p>

                     <h3>Solution</h3>
                     <p>We developed their elearning  curriculum from scratch.</p>
                     <p>We have continued to develop and support both the elearning we have developed but also the elearning that has been developed by other vendors.</p>
                     <p>We have assisted them in evaluation of LMS options and eventually built them a custom LMS when we couldnâ€™t find anything that met their specific requirements.</p>
                     <p>We continue to host, update, and maintain their LMS.</p>

                     <h3>Challenge</h3>
                     <p>The challenge was to maintain and update thorny legacy systems after the departure of their initial developer.</p>

                     <h3>Solution</h3>
                     <p>We were able to identify people with existing skill sets in an old tool and taught ourselves the systems in question.</p>
                     <p>We made initial updates to make the platforms more stable and in need of less maintenance.</p>
                     <p>We have been on call for issues and doing minimal maintenance for 10+ years.</p>

                     <p>Milady</p>

                     <h3>Challenge</h3>
                     <p>Milady needed to develop a number of courses quickly and efficiently using internal resources who are not developers, while at the same time maintaining a consistent look and feel with their existing products.</p>

                     <h3>Solution</h3>
                     <p>We developed a series of templates that their internal resources could use to assemble courses rapidly with only a basic understanding of the underlying authoring platform.</p>
                     <p>We trained their staff on the user of the templates as well as some aspects of the authoring platform that could allow them to extend the functionality the authoring tool.</p>

                     <p>They are in the process of developing 6 titles in less than 2 months.</p>

                     <p>If there is a particular project you are interested in seeing, please get in touch and we can arrange a demo.</p>
